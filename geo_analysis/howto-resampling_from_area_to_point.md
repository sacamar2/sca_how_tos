# The idea about this how to is to explain a way get a point which represents a squared areaThe use case starts with a random distribution of points which have a value and lat/long coordinates. Obviously, it can be applied to points with several numerical properties as well as other location representations.## 1.Define centroid of your datasetIn order to know where to create the areas, we need to have a first point of reference.## 2.Clean random datasetIn my case, I have a very cenrtalized dataset into a single city. If you have a very spread dataset and you want to keep it that way, you can skip this step.## 3.Define the squared areas## 4.Calculate the aggregation for each one## 5.Compose and write a geojson with the composed data
